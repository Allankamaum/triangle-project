# Triangle Tracker
#### This is an application that takes in three numbers and uses them to see what type of triangle it forms.
#### By **Allan kamau**
## Description
The application is run through a website that takes in three numbers which in my case is Length 1, length 2 and length 3. My version of the application does not constrict anyone from inputting anything but it will not work if the input is not in number form.I have coded the application to have 4 triangle type conditions namely:
Equilateral triangle, Isosceles Triangle, Scalene Triangle, NOT a Triangle.

## Behaviour Driven Development(BDD)
behaviour | Input | Output
------------|------------|------------
Not a triangle | 0, 0, 0 |This is Not a triangle
Equilateral | 5, 5, 5 | This is an Equilateral Triangle.
Isosceles | 2, 4, 2 |This is an Isosceles Triangle.
Scalene | 5, 6, 4 | This is a Scalene Triangle.

## Setup
* There are three input fields that take in the three different dimensions.
* A submit button has been added to put the values into a function that will output the type of triangle that the values fall under.
* A text is used to display the output

## Technologies Used
The application was made with HTML and css for the front end and java script to design the back end interface.
Atom text editor was used for the development and editing of the site.
